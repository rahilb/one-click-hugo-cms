  We've grown fond of Hammerton brewery over the last year - we've enjoyed their
  core range, tasted probably the best peanut butter stout in 'Crunch', and had
  a top night at their birthday bash!

Their latest release is Mango Masher, a 6.2% Mango Milkshake IPA. It pours a bright yellow colour with a thin white head hugging the side of the glass. It's one of the best smelling beers I've had for a while, with tropical aromas exactly like those you get in a can of Rubicon Mango!

To taste you get tropical fruits, predominantly mango, held in a silky smooth consistency. The beer finishes on very strong bitterness, maybe a little too much for some, but we'd definitely grab another can.
